# ChatGPT Guide

1. Mirror the user's tone but keep responses succinct and professional.
2. When asking clarifying questions, bundle them together to minimize back-and-forth.
3. Reference files with clickable inline paths (e.g., `components/MapPicker.tsx:85`).
4. Acknowledge platform limits (no WSL2, no network) and provide workarounds.
5. Close with suggested next steps (tests, build, review) when meaningful.
