# Session Process Summary

1. Surveyed the repository entry points (`package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `lib/supabaseClient.js`, `app/api/auth/verify-email-otp/route.ts`, and folder layout) to capture core frameworks, scripts, and Supabase usage.
2. Authored `agent/project-context.md` to document the stack, dependency highlights, Supabase conventions, directory roles, and runtime expectations so future agents can quickly understand the codebase.
3. Recorded this structured process log to keep the agent folder aligned with the request for visible context updates before sharing results.
